# Setting up application

- First download and setup Node.js and NPM: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
- Extract both `redacted` and `redacted-api` into two separate folders.
- Open command prompt, navigate into into `redacted/` using `cd` and run: `npm i`
- It should install all dependencies from `package.json`
- After this, go up a directory, and navigate into `redacted-api/`
  • Run `npm i` in this folder also.
  • Once complete, all relevant dependencies should be installed.

To start the server, in `redacted-api/` run:
`npm run start`
To start the client, in `redacted/` run
`npm run start`
